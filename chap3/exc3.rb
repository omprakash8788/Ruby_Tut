# The partner to the if statement is the else statement. An if/else statement says to Ruby: “If this expression is true, run this code block; otherwise, run the code after the else statement.” Here’s an example:

# if 1 > 2
#   print "I won't get printed because one is less than two."
# else
#   print "That means I'll get printed!"
# end

# Try it yourself in the editor! Use any expression you like in your if/else statement, but make sure both branches print a string of your choice to the console.

if 10 < 5
    puts "I'm not being printed because 10 is not less than 5!"
  else
    puts "10 is greater than 5, so I'm being printed."
  end
