# THE ZEN OF RUBY
# A Simpler 'If'
# 2 min
# You’ve seen the Ruby if statement before:

# if condition
#   # Do something!
# end

# If the “do something” is a short, simple expression, however, we can move it up into a single line (as you saw in the last exercise). The syntax looks like this:

# expression if boolean

# Ruby will expect an expression followed by if followed by a boolean. The order is important. You can do this:

# puts "It's true!" if true




# but not this:

# if true puts "It's true!"

# It’s also important to note that you don’t need an end when you write your if statement all on one line.

# Give it a go! Type a one-line if statement in the editor to the right. It can be whatever you

# Type your Ruby code below!
puts "It's true!" if true
