# Call .upcase on your name to make your name ALL CAPS and use puts to print it to the screen, like this:

# puts "eric".upcase    # ==> ERIC

# On the next line, call .downcase to make your name all lower case. Make sure to use puts so you can see it printed out!


puts "Jamie".upcase

puts "Jamie".downcase
