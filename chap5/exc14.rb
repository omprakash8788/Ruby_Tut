# LOOPS & ITERATORS
# Looping with 'While'
# 4 min
# Okay, training wheels off. Let’s see your stuff!

# i = 3
# while i > 0 do
#   print i
#   i -= 1
# end

# In the above example, we create a variable called i and set it to 3.
# Then, we print out 321 since we execute the loop as long as i is positive.
# Instructions

# Use a while loop to print out the numbers 1 through 50, inclusive. While the example above counts down, you will want to count up.Use print rather than puts, and don’t forget to increment your variable.


i = 1
while i <= 50
  print i
  i += 1
end
